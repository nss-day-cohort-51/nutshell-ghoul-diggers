## Description

Nutshell is a React App built for users to have the capability to post and view news articles, local events, and post public/private messages with their added friends. It focuses on a sleek, simple, and interactive design that makes it easy for the user to digest the content of the webpage. We achieved this by selecting a vibrant-like color scheme and structuring the layout of the page in a spacious, yet efficient way. We focused on creating an elegant design while also having strong user functionality.
